Extensions are exactly as they sound - they "extend" the database with functionality which isn't part of the Postgres core.
Supabase has pre-installed some of the most useful open source extensions.

### Enable and disable extensions

<Tabs
  scrollable
  size="small"
  type="underlined"
  defaultActiveId="dashboard"
>
<TabPanel id="dashboard" label="Dashboard">

1. Go to the [Database](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/database/tables) page in the Dashboard.
2. Click **Extensions** in the sidebar.
3. Enable or disable an extension.

</TabPanel>
<TabPanel id="sql" label="SQL">

```sql
 -- Example: enable the "pgtap" extension and ensure it is installed
create extension pgtap
with
  schema extensions;

-- Example: disable the "pgtap" extension
drop
  extension pgtap;
```

Even though the SQL code is `create extension`, this is the equivalent of "enabling the extension".
To disable an extension call `drop extension`.

</TabPanel>
</Tabs>

<Admonition type="note">

Most extensions are installed under the `extensions` schema. This schema is accessible to public by default.

If you need to restrict user access to certain extensions, it is recommended to create a separate schema for installing that specific extension.

Some extensions like postgis must be created under a predefined schema. If you are missing access privileges from the dashboard, please file a support ticket.

### Full list of extensions

Supabase is pre-configured with over 50 extensions. You can also install your own SQL extensions directly in the database through our SQL editor.
